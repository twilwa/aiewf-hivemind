# AI-Powered Commerce Platform Discussion

## Key Takeaways

- **API-First Architecture**: Creating consistent APIs to handle complex merchant systems (e.g., Samsung's vertical integration)
- **Data Integration Strategy**: Connecting product data with other data sources to construct seller intent and enable AI-driven interfaces
- **Payment Flow Innovation**: Enabling transaction handling on new AI-powered surfaces/bots
- **Merchant Data Aggregation**: Building a platform that aggregates over merchants rather than financial institutions or individual products
- **Legacy Company Adaptation**: Large, established companies (100+ years old) are surprisingly forward-thinking about technological shifts due to their survival experience

## Relevance

### For Platform Design
- **Unified API Strategy**: Essential for handling diverse merchant systems and creating consistent data access
- **AI Subdomain Architecture**: Enables rapid experimentation and interface generation using both product and brand data
- **Transaction Integration**: Critical consideration for AI commerce platforms to handle end-to-end customer experience

### For Engineering Implementation
- **Data Source Integration**: Need robust systems to connect and normalize data from multiple merchant sources
- **LLM Integration**: Platform designed to work with language models for customer service and interface generation
- **Scalability Considerations**: Architecture must handle complex, varied merchant systems while maintaining performance

### For Business Strategy
- **Market Positioning**: Alternative to individual merchant integrations by providing centralized platform
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Focus on established companies who understand the need for technological adaptation
- **Competitive Advantage**: Inversion of typical .com website posture creates new opportunities for brand engagement

## Technical Architecture Notes

1. **Step 1**: Create unified API for complex merchant systems
2. **Step 2**: Connect product data with external data sources
3. **Step 3**: Feed into experimentation container with AI subdomain
4. **Step 4**: Enable payment flow integration for bot surfaces

## Historical Context

- Reference to companies like Samsung evolving from different industries (TVs in 70s, modern tech by 90s)
- Emphasis on how century-old companies have survived multiple technological shifts
- Comparison to financial trading systems (Bridgewater experience mentioned)



# E-commerce product data API strategy for AI commerce platforms

Thu, 05 Jun 25

### Key Technical Challenges in AI Commerce

- Complex product bundling across multiple merchants
    
- Product availability tracking across thousands of stores
    
- Current suboptimal solutions:
    
    - Product feed infrastructure requiring individual merchant integration
        
    - Web scraping which creates repetitive work and bot traffic
        
- Proposed solution: Unified API for product data access across merchants
    

### Infrastructure & Intelligence Components

- Buyer/seller representation system
    
    - Current: Limited to transaction data and quarterly reports
        
    - Future: Rich user context and real-time business strategic goals
        
- Trust and verification
    
    - Need third-party institutions and market makers (similar to finance industry)
        
- Intelligence layer requirements:
    
    - Consumer/merchant preference reasoning
        
    - Real-time interface generation
        
    - Coordination across participants
        

### Samsung Implementation Case Study

- Background: Evolution from Korean fish merchant to global tech leader
    
- Implementation steps:
    
    - API/MCP server creation handling 10 different verticals
        
    - Integration of product data with company data sources
        
    - AI subdomain for generative interface testing
        
    - Identity and transaction handling for bot-driven commerce
        
- Results: AI chat users show higher intent and better conversion rates
    

### Future of Commerce Q&A

- Payment solutions:
    
    - State coins/crypto potential for native AI payments
        
    - Credit cards as practical bridge solution
        
    - Possibility of agent-owned perpetual credit cards
        
- Revenue model:
    
    - Moving away from traditional advertising
        
    - Likely shift toward affiliate revenue
        
    - Attribution-based compensation for quality data provision
