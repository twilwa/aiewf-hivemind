## Key Takeaways

- **Avoid Micro-Management**: Don't use AI agents like chatbots that require constant steering and review of every interaction
- **Proper Prompting is Critical**: Under-prompting is a common anti-pattern that leads to poor agent performance
- **Fast Feedback Loops Matter**: Agents benefit from quick iteration cycles, similar to human developers using auto-reload features
- **Developer Experience Focus**: When working with agents, you become a "developer experience engineer" optimizing for agent efficiency
- **Real-World Applications**: Serious engineering projects are successfully using AI agents, including compiler development work
- **Learning Through Practice**: The best way to master AI agent tools is through hands-on experience and sharing knowledge with others

## Relevance

### For AI Agent Development

- **Feedback Loop Optimization**: Implement fast feedback mechanisms (like Storybook integration) to accelerate agent development cycles
- **Prompting Strategy**: Develop comprehensive prompting techniques to avoid under-specification issues
- **Autonomy Balance**: Design agents with appropriate levels of independence while maintaining necessary oversight

### For Developer Tooling

- **Integration Patterns**: Consider how AI agents interact with existing development tools and workflows
- **Security Considerations**: Implement proper whitelisting and endpoint management for agent-accessible resources
- **User Experience**: Focus on creating smooth developer experiences that don't require constant manual intervention

### For Engineering Teams

- **Adoption Strategy**: Recognize that AI agents can handle serious engineering tasks, not just simple automation
- **Skill Development**: Invest time in learning effective agent interaction patterns and best practices
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Establish practices for sharing successful agent implementation patterns across teams
# Sculpture: AI coding agent research preview

Thu, 05 Jun 25

### Project Status

- Presented technical decisions and design overview of Sculpture, an experimental coding agent environment
    
- Research preview phase - features may change before release
    
- Currently focused on solving the specific challenge of code quality assessment and trust building in AI-generated code
    
- Developed system to analyze code diffs and identify potential issues (race conditions, security concerns like API keys)
    

### Current Roadblocks

- Identified gap between current AI coding tool outputs and production-ready code
    
- Basic problems (performance, cost, speed, output parsing) will likely be solved by industry in 3-24 months
    
- Challenge of verifying quality of AI-generated code (example given: “59 new lines” - difficult to assess quality)
    

### Upcoming Tasks and Milestones

- Implementing learning capabilities to research existing technologies and solutions
    
- Developing planning features to encourage structured approach before code generation
    
- Creating workflow for Scrabble solver implementation with forced planning phase
    
- Working on icon customization on settings page (demonstrated during meeting)
    

### Team Collaboration and Action Items

No specific team collaboration items or action items were discussed in this solo meeting/presentation.
