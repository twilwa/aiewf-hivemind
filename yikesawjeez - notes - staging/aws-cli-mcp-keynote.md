# Strands Agents: Open Source AI Agent Development Overview

Wed, 04 Jun 25

### Product Overview - Strands Agents

- Open source pipeline SDK for building and running AI agents
    
- Model-driven approach leveraging LLM capabilities
    
- Name origin: AI-generated, inspired by DNA strands connecting models and tools
    
- Simplifies agent building by focusing on reasoning and planning rather than explicit instructions
    

### Technical Implementation

- Basic setup requires minimal code:
    
    - Install Strands Agents
        
    - Import required components
        
    - Add tools to agent
        
    - Configure model settings
        
- Default integration with Amazon Bedrock and Claude 4.7
    
- Supports multiple providers:
    
    - Anthropic
        
    - Meta’s Llama
        
    - OpenAI
        
    - Custom providers via LightLLM integration
        

### Built-in Capabilities

- 20+ prebuilt tools including:
    
    - File manipulation
        
    - API calls
        
    - AWS service integration
        
    - Memory and RAG functionality
        
    - Semantic search (handles 6,000+ tools in AWS internal implementation)
        
    - Multimodal support (images, video, audio)
        
    - Multi-agent workflows
        
    - Deep reasoning capabilities
        

### MCP Integration

- Native integration with Mechanical Components Protocol (MCP)
    
- AWS-specific implementations available in AWS-labs/mcp repository
    
- Deployment options:
    
    - Standard I/O for local development
        
    - Lambda functions for cloud deployment
        
    - API Gateway integration with authorization
        
- Example demonstrated: D20 dice rolling implementation using:
    
    - Lambda function
        
    - DynamoDB for session storage
        
    - AWS SAM for deployment
        
    - API Gateway for endpoint exposure
        

### Future Direction

- Focus on agent-to-agent communication
    
- Active participation in MCP steering committee
    
- Vision: Personal agents connecting to agent stores
    
- Referenced Joan Xie’s quote: “The atomic unit of all digital interactions will be an agent call”

## Key Takeaways

- **AWS Strands Agents** comes with 20+ pre-built tools for various tasks from file manipulation to complex API integrations
- **MCP (Model Control Protocol) Integration**: Native support within Strands for connecting to thousands of available MCP servers
- **Scalable Tool Management**: AWS developed an MCP Lambda handler for easy deployment of MCP servers as Lambda functions
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, and local models through LightNLM integration
- **Tool Discovery at Scale**: Internal AWS agent manages 6,000+ tools using semantic search over knowledge bases to find relevant tools
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Built-in support for graph-based workflows and sub-agents working together
- **Security Integration**: Supports API Gateway with authorization, Cognito framework, and session data storage in DynamoDB
