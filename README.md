Feel free to upload any transctiptions, videos, or slides/photos and tag them with their corresponding talk. You can add yaml frontmatter tags in your text editor like so:

---
tags: 

---

If you download https://obsidian.md/, you'll be able to open this Vault in the Obsidian UI; when adding tags, you can type '---' at the top of the note to use the GUI tags option.

You should turn on 'Community Plugins' > 'Git' in settings, this way, you can use ctrl+P for the command pallette and push your changes up to your fork. Feel free to PR those changes in to the main repo, or keep them on your own branch (contributions encouraged!)

If you have questions, you can contact me on slack (@yikesawjeez is my handle, you can search that on the AIEWF slack and I should pop up. Also Discord, X, et cetera if you have further questions.)

Currently, I have some notes in my main vault but haven't uploaded yet. Please use [[backlinks]] and tags to organize your notes if they connect to other notes in the vault!
